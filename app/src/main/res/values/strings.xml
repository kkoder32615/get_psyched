    <string name="get_psyched_launcher_msg">Thank you for choosing Get Psyched! We aim to be your
    go-to source for information and harm reduction tips. The first version of this app only
        contains information about LSD, but will be updated over time to include different mushrooms
        and DMT. Once that is finished we will start adding other tryptamines, phenethylamines and
        various research chemicals.
